# [Simple Chess Quiz](https://seanysean.github.io/quiz/)

Something I made to (once again) practice my coding skills. Feel free to contribute code, or questions. The syntax for adding a new question is:

```js
const z = new Question('Question',['(Correct option)','...more options...']);
```
Have fun playing!
